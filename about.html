  <h1> About me </h1>
  
  <p>
    My name is Suraiya, and I am currently a junior at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in Biological Sciences and am only a class or two away
    from a minor in Anthropology. I am very excited to be taking this computer science course as it will give me the background knowledge I need to further my 
    educational and professional career.
